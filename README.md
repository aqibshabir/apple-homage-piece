# Apple Homage Piece

## The Brief:

To create a landing page using only HTML and CSS. This challenege is to showcase my HTML and CSS skills by limiting myself to this tech-stack. I chose to focus on the apple website as their subtle design was something I always found intesresting and I wanted to pay homage to them by replicating their website.

## Reflection:

This task was completed near the start of my bootcamp adventure. I found the task very rewarding as I was able to really pay attention to all the small details that the apple website implented.

This task honed my skills in CSS and semantic HTML but I feel like now that I have come full-circle there is some things I would change. For example:

On the apple website there is no clear h1 and therefore I made the decision not to incorperate one. Looking back however, I feel like I could have included one and have it not be displayed - more so for accessibility reasons.

I also feel like the navbar could have been implemented using radio buttons to prevent any unfavourable behaviour from occuring. This is evident when clicking multiple icons in the navbar (mobile view), you can see that if they are all clicked they remain open.

Having said this, I think overall this is a very well thought out and well designed piece. I like the level of detail that went into achieving the result. It very closely mimics the apple home page and I am happy with the end result.
